# Rental bike ML prediction project.
> To model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
    task is to model the predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
- What is the background of your project?
    EDA, data-processing, multiple linear regression, devoid of multicollinearity.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    predicting the future forecast.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
    Rental bike data.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- list of significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes
    yr
    holiday
    workingday
    temp
    windspeed
    weekday_6
    mnth_9
    season_2
    season_4
    weathersit_2
    weathersit_3

- Temp (co-efficient: 0.5983), year (co-efficient: 0.2349), and winter season (co-efficient: 0.1257) has important role.
- comapny should focus more on weathersit_3, windspeed and weekday_6 for better expansion.
